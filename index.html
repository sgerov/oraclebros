						<span class="title">Backup node migration</span>
						<p>We've switched where our Backup node was running to a new location so it will be sync-ing for some time. We aren't starting from a DB backup this time but syncing through network since we don't want to affect our Main node.</p>

<p>If an issue with our main node arose during this period we would transfer quickly all data to the backup location and spin it up quickier.</p>

<p>We also took the opportunity to update the backup to <code>1.0.2</code> (main was already migrated)</p>

						
							<p><em>Update <span class="moment">2021-10-23 13:36:40 UTC</span></em></p>
							<p>Sync has completed, the node is ready for a switch if needed</p>

						<span class="title">Rolling uptime down to 99.9%</span>
						<p>After our infrastructure upgrade we didn't expect missing proposals, having a look on the cause for going down to 99.93%</p>

						
							<p><em>Update <span class="moment">2021-10-24 19:11:01 UTC</span></em></p>
							<p>We identified an issue with our inbound connections on port 30000, we are working on a fix</p>

						<span class="title">Rolling uptime down to 99.3%</span>
						<p>The node is stable although we missed some proposals in the last two weeks. The team is having a look</p>

						
							<p><em>Update <span class="moment">2021-09-30 08:29:24 UTC</span></em></p>
							<p>According to the community the network has been clumsy and many validators have been missing proposals, still we are more affected then others according to <a href="https://explorer.radixdlt.com/#/validators">Radix dashboard</a></p>

						
							<p><em>Update <span class="moment">2021-10-01 07:47:29 UTC</span></em></p>
							<p>No clear reason behind the missed proposals. Metrics look good, no particular spikes nor weird behaviour.The Validator has enough resources. We are considering moving our cluster to a different region / provider. No clear motivation to use the Backup Node since both have very similar behaviour</p>

						
							<p><em>Update <span class="moment">2021-10-02 09:35:33 UTC</span></em></p>
							<p>We are currently looking at the following actions:</p>

<ul>
<li>Spin up a dedicated server instead of VPS for our main node</li>
<li>Increase log retention policy since we don't have enough data to look for inconsistencies</li>
<li>Increase monitoring retention policy, we would like to be able to look further in time to be able to detect patterns in a more informed manner</li>
<li>Refine alerting rules</li>
</ul>

<p>We will keep you informed, we aren't rushing the decision since the node is rather stable currently.</p>

						
							<p><em>Update <span class="moment">2021-10-03 16:15:56 UTC</span></em></p>
							<p>We just finalised getting a dedicated server to avoid unknown unknowns when it comes to our Validator performance. The node will be up and running within the next hours and we will proceed with synchronising with Olympia which we expect to take around 6-7 hours before we do the actual switch</p>

						
							<p><em>Update <span class="moment">2021-10-03 20:31:16 UTC</span></em></p>
							<p>We finished migrating our Validator to a new dedicated server</p>

						
							<p><em>Update <span class="moment">2021-10-03 20:43:31 UTC</span></em></p>
							<p>We will be closely monitoring the behaviour of the node with the new servers and maintain this issue open until we see UPTIME is back as it has always been: 100%!</p>

						
							<p><em>Update <span class="moment">2021-10-03 20:50:17 UTC</span></em></p>
							<p>First check on our metrics is looking good:</p>

							<p><em>Update <span class="moment">2021-10-04 07:58:15 UTC</span></em></p>
							<p>We were randomising the validator port we were opening for gossiping, we had <code>30498</code> open instead of <code>30000</code>. Hardcoded it to <code>30000</code></p>

						
							<p><em>Update <span class="moment">2021-10-08 12:49:32 UTC</span></em></p>
							<p>We've been very stable for the last week and are back at 100% uptime</p>
